# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).  
I use this space to practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills.  

## Structure
- Each folder/file corresponds to a specific problem.  
- Solutions are written in **C++**  
- Code is organized for readability and easy reference.  

## Goals
- Improve my understanding of algorithms and data structures.  
- Build consistency by solving problems regularly.  
- Track my progress and share my journey in competitive programming.  

## Notes
- All solutions are my own implementations.  
- I try to include explanations or comments whenever possible.
