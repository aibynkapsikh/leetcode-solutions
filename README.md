# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).  
I use this space to practice competitive programming, algorithms, and data structures.  

## Structure
- Each file corresponds to a specific Codeforces problem.  
- Solutions are written in **C++**  
- Code is organized for readability and easy reference.  

## Goals
- Improve my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.  
- Build consistency by solving problems regularly.  
- Track my progress and share my journey in competitive programming.  

## Notes
- All solutions are my own implementations.  
- I try to include comments or explanations whenever possible.

ðŸš€ This repository will grow as I continue solving Codeforces problems.
